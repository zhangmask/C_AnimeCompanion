"""MCP service: expose jobs as MCP tools.

Channel binding (the `<channel source="reme" kind="workspace_change" ...>`
push from background steps to a specific Claude Code window) is uniform
across transports: a single `ChannelSink` lives on
`ApplicationContext.metadata["channel_sink"]`, unbound at startup, and any
client calling the `claim_channel` MCP tool binds itself as the recipient
via `fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_context().session`. Last-claim-wins.

Under stdio (one client per server process) the client should claim once
after init; until then channel events drop silently. Under shared
streamable-http / sse the human picks which window receives events.

``ChannelSink`` is colocated here because it is the runtime mechanism
behind this service's channel feature — pushes ``notifications/claude/channel``
frames to the bound MCP session. Lossy by design: not bound → no-op;
``send_message`` raises → log warning, swallow (failed notifications must
not surface as ingest failures). Uses ``ServerSession.send_message``
(low-level raw frame) instead of ``send_notification`` because the latter
validates against a closed ``ServerNotification`` RootModel union that
does not include ``notifications/claude/channel`` — Pydantic rejects
custom methods. Meta keys are filtered to ``[A-Za-z0-9_]+``: Claude Code
silently drops keys with hyphens / other chars when projecting onto
``<channel>`` attrs.
