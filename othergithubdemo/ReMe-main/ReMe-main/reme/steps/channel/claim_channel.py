"""``claim_channel_step`` — let an MCP client elect itself as the ``<channel>`` recipient.

The single bind path for every transport (stdio, sse, streamable-http):
this step uses ``fastmcp.server.dependencies.get_context()`` to grab the
current request's ``ServerSession`` and ``ChannelSink.bind`` it.

Semantics:

* **Last-claim-wins.** A second client calling ``claim_channel`` silently
  replaces the previous binding; the prior leader stops receiving events.
* **Lossy on leader loss.** If the bound session goes away, the next
  ``send_message`` raises and ``ChannelSink`` swallows it as a warning.
  Events drop until another client claims.
* **stdio = trivially the one client.** Under stdio there is exactly one
  session ever; calling ``claim_channel`` once after init binds it for
  the rest of the server's life. Until then, channel events drop.
