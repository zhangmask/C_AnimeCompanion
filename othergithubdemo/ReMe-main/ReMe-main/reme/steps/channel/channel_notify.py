"""``channel_notify_step`` — push a debounced batch of workspace changes as one channel event.

Designed to be slotted into ``watch_changes_step.dispatch_steps`` next to
``update_index_step``: when the watcher emits a batch of changes, this
step forwards a single human-readable summary to
``ApplicationContext.metadata["channel_sink"]``. The Claude Code main
session then sees a ``<channel source="reme" kind="workspace_change" ...>``
tag and reacts per the server's ``instructions``.

One event per batch (not per file) — the watcher already de-bounces and
de-duplicates, so a batch is a meaningful "things that changed together"
unit. Putting N events on the wire per batch would multiply session
turns without adding signal.

No-op (silently) when:

* ``channel_sink`` is absent from the application context metadata
  (e.g. service wasn't an ``MCPService``), so this step is safe in
  any pipeline.
* ``context['changes']`` is missing or empty.
* The sink itself has no bound session (no client called ``claim_channel``).
