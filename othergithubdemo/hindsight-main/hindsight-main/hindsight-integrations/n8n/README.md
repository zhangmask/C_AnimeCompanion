# @vectorize-io/n8n-nodes-hindsight

[Hindsight](https://hindsight.vectorize.io) memory nodes for [n8n](https://n8n.io) — give any n8n workflow persistent long-term memory with **retain**, **recall**, and **reflect** operations.

Drop a Hindsight node anywhere in a workflow to:

- **Retain** facts emerging from a workflow (form submissions, CRM updates, customer chat) into a memory bank
- **Recall** relevant context before an LLM step so the AI sees prior history
- **Reflect** to get an LLM-synthesized answer over the bank's accumulated knowledge

## Installation

In n8n, go to **Settings → Community Nodes → Install** and enter:

```
@vectorize-io/n8n-nodes-hindsight
```

Or install via npm in your self-hosted n8n:

```bash
cd ~/.n8n/custom
npm install @vectorize-io/n8n-nodes-hindsight
```

Restart n8n and the **Hindsight** node appears in the node panel.

| Query       | Natural-language query                            |
| Budget      | `low` / `mid` / `high` — controls retrieval depth |
| Max Tokens  | Cap on returned memory tokens                     |
| Tags Filter | Filter memories by tag                            |

Returns: `{ results: [{ text, score, ... }, ...] }`

### Reflect — LLM-synthesized answer

| Field   | Description               |
| ------- | ------------------------- |

## Example workflows

**Customer-support assistant** — every closed Zendesk ticket retains the resolution; every new ticket starts with a recall against the bank to surface similar past issues.

**Sales-call coach** — Gong webhook → Hindsight Retain (call summary). Before each next prep call, recall on the prospect's name to pull every prior touchpoint.

**Personal Slack bot** — Slack DM trigger → Hindsight Recall on the user's question, pass through to OpenAI node, reply.
