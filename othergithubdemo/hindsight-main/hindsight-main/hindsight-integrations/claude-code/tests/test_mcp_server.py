"""Regression tests for mcp_server.py.

The MCP server runs as a stdio subprocess; the Claude Code MCP client buffers
up to 16 MB looking for a JSON-RPC message boundary (newline) and disconnects
if a single response exceeds that ceiling. The /mental-models LIST endpoint
defaults to detail=full, which returns synthesized content + reflect_response
for every page in the bank — at realistic agent scales (tens of pages with
~100 KB content each) this exceeds 16 MB in a single response and triggers a
deterministic disconnect during agent_knowledge_list_pages. The fix is to
request detail=metadata, which the API supports specifically for this use case
(see the upstream PR that added the parameter: "reduces payload for agent
boot flows and MCP clients where context budget is limited").
