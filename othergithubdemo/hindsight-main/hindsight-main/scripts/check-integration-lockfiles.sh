# Ensures every `hindsight-integrations/*/package-lock.json` resolves its
# dependencies from a public npm registry — not from a monorepo workspace
# symlink, a `file:` URL, or a relative path.
#
# Why this matters: integrations are published by `.github/workflows/
# release-integration.yml`, which runs `npm ci && npm run build` inside the
# integration directory. If the lockfile points at a workspace path whose
# `dist/` is gitignored and not pre-built in the release runner, tsc fails
# with `Cannot find module '@vectorize-io/...'`.
#
# This bit us once on integrations/openclaw/v0.6.0 — the lockfile had
# @vectorize-io/hindsight-client resolved to ../../hindsight-clients/typescript
# because `npm install` was originally run from the monorepo root, where npm
# silently preferred the workspace even though openclaw isn't itself listed
# in the root `workspaces` array. The test CI job masked it (it pre-builds
# workspace deps), but the release workflow doesn't.
#
# How to fix a flagged lockfile: from inside the integration directory,
#   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
#   npm install
# Never run `npm install` from the monorepo root for these integrations.
