"""Regression: sub-batch slices that each span MULTIPLE extraction chunks must
keep full chunk coverage on BOTH the sync (inline) and async (submitted) retain
paths.

Two distinct bugs hid behind the same symptom — ingesting a large plain-text
document dropped most of its body (and any fact past the first slice). Both only
trigger when an oversized single item is split into sequential sub-batches whose
*slices each re-chunk into several extraction chunks* (the default config: batch
tokens 10k → ~30k-char slices, re-chunked at 3k → ~10 chunks/slice):

1. chunk_index offset (sync + async). retain_batch_async advanced the per-document
   chunk_index cursor by re-chunking ``item["content"]`` AFTER the orchestrator
   had consumed (popped) it — ``chunk_text("")`` returns ``[""]`` (count 1), so
   the cursor moved by 1 per sub-batch instead of by the real chunk count. Later
   slices restarted ~1 slot in, colliding ``chunk_id = {bank}_{doc}_{index}`` and
   overwriting earlier chunks via upsert.

2. whole-document recovery skip (async only). All sub-batches of one submitted
   operation share one ``operation_id``; the first slice stamps the document into
   ``result_metadata.facts_committed_document_ids``. The crash-recovery fast-path
   then saw every later slice's document already "committed" and skipped
   extraction entirely, so only the first slice survived.

The existing #1888 coverage tests use ``RETAIN_BATCH_TOKENS=100`` (a ~300-char
budget, under the chunk size) so every slice collapses to ONE chunk — which masks
both bugs (offset-by-1 happens to equal the real count, and a 1-chunk doc isn't
re-sliced). These tests size the body so each slice fans out to ~6 chunks, with
globally-unique tokens so no chunk-hash dedup hides a dropped slice, and assert
full coverage + contiguous indices + a needle planted in a late slice.
