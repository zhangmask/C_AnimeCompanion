"""
Regression tests for vectorize-io/hindsight#980.

Deterministic Postgres integrity-constraint violations (UniqueViolationError,
ForeignKeyViolationError, CheckViolationError, NotNullViolationError,
ExclusionViolationError) must NOT be retried by the worker — they will never
succeed on retry, and retrying just burns worker capacity for ~3 minutes
(3 retries × 60s) before finally giving up.

These tests verify that ``MemoryEngine.execute_task`` classifies
``asyncpg.exceptions.IntegrityConstraintViolationError`` as non-retryable
and marks the operation as failed on the first occurrence.
