"""Recall projects entities for observations through source_memory_ids.

Observations don't carry rows in `unit_entities`; their entity association
lives transitively via `memory_units.source_memory_ids`. The per-memory
endpoint (`get_memory_unit`) follows that chain, but recall used to query
`unit_entities` directly and silently dropped entities for every observation
result, even when `include_entities=True` was set.

This test seeds an observation linked through `source_memory_ids` to a fact
with entities, runs an observation-only recall, and asserts both the
per-result `entities` field and the top-level aggregate map carry the
inherited entities.

No LLM required.
