"""Regression guard for the silent re-queue failure path (issue #1842).

The consolidator used to wrap its round-limit re-queue in a permissive
try/except (consolidator.py:606-613):

    try:
        await memory_engine.submit_async_consolidation(...)
    except Exception as e:
        logger.warning("... failed to re-queue consolidation: %s", e)

If ``submit_async_consolidation`` raised for any reason (DB hiccup, custom
operation-validator rejection, etc.) the failure was logged but otherwise
swallowed. The consolidator returned "completed", ``execute_task`` marked
the op completed normally, and **no follow-up pending op was created**.
The bank ended up with unconsolidated backlog and zero pending consolidation
work — exactly the "16 of 17 backlogged banks have no running or pending op"
symptom from issue #1842.

The fix removes the try/except and lets the exception propagate to
``execute_task``'s retry handler. The op is retried with backoff; on retry
the consolidator skips already-consolidated rows via the ``consolidated_at``
filter and picks up the remainder. Eventually the work drains and the op is
marked completed.

This test asserts the new contract: a failing re-queue must NOT silently
complete the op. Either a follow-up pending row exists, or the op is in a
retryable state (raises RetryTaskAt → worker reschedules it).
