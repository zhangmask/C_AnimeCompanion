"""Drop materialized entity rows from memory_links.

Entity edges are no longer stored in ``memory_links``. The /graph endpoint
derives them on demand from ``unit_entities``, and recall already used the
``unit_entities`` self-join. Storing entity rows duplicated state we never
read from the link table — on a 10k-unit benchmark bank, entity rows were
53% of all link rows (~190 MB after indexes) and recall never touched them.

This migration deletes ``memory_links`` rows with ``link_type = 'entity'``.
``idx_memory_links_entity_covering`` was already dropped by migration
``e1b2c3d4f5a6``; we still issue ``DROP INDEX IF EXISTS`` defensively in case
this migration runs against an older snapshot that predates that one.
