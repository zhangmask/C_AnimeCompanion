"""backsweep_orphan_observations_v2

Re-run of Pass 2 from migration ``g7h8i9j0k1l2_backsweep_orphan_observations``
to sweep observations that became orphaned between then and now.

Why we need it again:
  ``fact_storage.handle_document_tracking`` (the retain/upsert path) deleted
  the existing document via the FK cascade — which removes the source
  ``memory_units`` — but never invalidated the observations derived from
  them.  Only the explicit ``MemoryEngine.delete_document`` API called
  ``_delete_stale_observations_for_memories``.  Every document re-ingest
  therefore left orphan observations whose ``source_memory_ids`` arrays
  pointed at IDs that no longer existed in ``memory_units``.

  ``handle_document_tracking`` now calls the same cleanup helper before the
  cascade, so no new orphans will accumulate going forward.  This migration
  cleans up the historical residue.

Identical to Pass 2 of g7h8i9j0k1l2.  Pass 1 (memory_units whose bank is
gone) is intentionally not re-run; that scenario has no fresh source.
