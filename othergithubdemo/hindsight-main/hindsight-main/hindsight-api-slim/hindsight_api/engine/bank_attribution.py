"""Per-bank provider cost attribution via the OpenAI ``user`` field.

Shared by the OpenAI-compatible LLM path and the OpenAI embeddings path so both
tag outbound requests identically. Opt-in via ``HINDSIGHT_API_LLM_SEND_BANK_AS_USER``;
downstream cost gateways (OpenRouter usage accounting, LiteLLM, Helicone) key spend
on the OpenAI ``user`` field.

Note: when enabled, the bank id is transmitted to the upstream provider as the
end-user identifier. Banks that are themselves end-user identifiers are therefore
forwarded to the provider — which is exactly what the OpenAI ``user`` field is for,
but operators should opt in with that in mind.
