"""Registry of optional PostgreSQL server-side routines.

Some hot paths (currently only the worker poller's per-cycle scan) can be
sped up by a server-side PL/pgSQL routine that the API never installs
itself — operators install it out-of-band (e.g. a Helm hook in
hindsight-cloud) when they want the optimisation. When the routine is not
installed, callers must fall back to a pure-Python implementation.

This module centralises that pattern so we don't sprinkle ad-hoc
``try / except`` blocks (which silently log a server-side error on every
call) around the codebase. Each registered entry carries:

* a ``schema`` and ``name`` (used to probe ``pg_proc``)
* a ``contract`` describing the expected signature and return shape

Bodies are deliberately not stored here. Hindsight never installs these
routines, so a body checked into this repo would (a) drift from whatever
operators actually deploy and (b) imply ownership we don't have. The
contract is the entire API surface: any operator-supplied implementation
that satisfies it is interchangeable.

Probe behaviour:

* On first ``is_installed()`` call per backend instance we issue a single
  ``SELECT EXISTS(...) FROM pg_proc`` and cache the boolean result in
  memory for the life of the process.
* No TTL: if an operator installs a routine on a running cluster, workers
  pick it up only after restart. This is intentional — these routines are
  expected to be installed once at deploy time, and a probe-per-poll would
  defeat the optimisation.
* Non-PostgreSQL backends short-circuit to ``False`` without touching the
  database, so callers can use the same code path for Oracle.

PostgreSQL terminology note: ``CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS SETOF`` defines
a *function* (invoked via ``SELECT``); ``CREATE PROCEDURE`` defines a
*procedure* (invoked via ``CALL``). The SQL-standard umbrella term
covering both is *routine*, and the system catalog (``pg_proc``) stores
both. The module name uses "routine" so a future ``CREATE PROCEDURE``
entry slots in without a rename.

    contract="""
    Signature:  public.schemas_with_pending_work() RETURNS SETOF text

    Called by the worker poller on every cycle to find schemas with
    claimable async_operations rows. The poller then runs FOR UPDATE
    SKIP LOCKED only against the returned schemas, so an empty set means
    "nothing to do, skip the expensive claim query".

    A schema is "claimable" iff at least one row matches:
        status = 'pending' AND task_payload IS NOT NULL
    in that schema's ``async_operations`` table.

    Required semantics:
      * No arguments.
      * Returns a set of schema names (``text``); each must match a real
        ``pg_namespace.nspname``. The poller passes them straight into
        the claim query — anything that isn't a valid schema will fail.
      * Operators choose the search scope (e.g. ``tenant_%`` only, or
        include ``public``). A schema omitted from the scan will *never*
        be serviced by the poller, so the implementation must cover
        every schema that holds an ``async_operations`` table in that
        deployment.
      * Should be cheap and idempotent — called every poll cycle (~30s).

    The poller trusts the result wholesale: any schema the routine does
    not return is treated as having no work this cycle. It does NOT
    second-guess omissions with a per-schema scan — that would re-run the
    exact queries this routine exists to avoid. Consequently the routine
    is *only* appropriate for multi-tenant deployments. Single-schema
    (default/public only) installs should NOT create it: the per-schema
    fallback below is a single cheap EXISTS check that covers ``public``
    correctly and cannot starve.

    Fallback when the routine is absent: per-schema ``EXISTS`` queries
    from Python (~4ms per schema). The server-side path is a single-
    round-trip optimisation worth ~200ms in deployments with thousands
    of tenant schemas; everything else works correctly without it.
