"""Shared resource-name resolution for the media parsers (image / audio / video).

A staged upload reaches a parser as a temp file named ``upload_<uuid>.<ext>``.
The caller's real name arrives via the ``resource_name`` / ``source_name``
kwargs (the markdown parser already honors these, and ``media_processor`` passes
``resource_name`` through). Centralizing the resolution keeps the three media
parsers in lockstep so the resource's filename, URI and title reflect the real
upload instead of the internal temp id.

    Honors a caller-supplied ``resource_name`` / ``source_name``, reducing it to
    its stem only when the trailing suffix is a known media extension (so a
    filename-like value such as ``"photo.png"`` does not double its extension,
    while a name that merely contains a dot like ``"meeting.v1"`` is preserved).
    When neither is supplied, falls back to the temp file name with behavior
    byte-identical to the historical inline logic.

    Args:
        file_path: the temp (or source) file path the parser is reading.
        ext: the resource extension to use (the parser passes ``file_path.suffix``).
        **kwargs: parser kwargs; ``resource_name`` / ``source_name`` are consulted.

    Returns:
        display_stem: human-readable name for the title / metadata fields.
        path_stem: ``display_stem`` with spaces -> underscores, for URI segments.
        original_filename: the resource's internal filename.
