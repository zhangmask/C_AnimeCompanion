# Operation Telemetry Reference

Operation telemetry lets you ask OpenViking to return a compact summary of what happened during a request, such as duration, token usage, vector retrieval activity, queue progress, and resource-processing stages.

Use it when you want to:

- debug a slow or unexpected request
- inspect token or retrieval behavior
- capture structured execution data in your own logs or observability pipeline

For the broader observability entry points, including health checks, `ov tui`, and `OpenViking Console`, see [Observability & Diagnostics](05-observability.md).

## How it works

Telemetry is opt-in. OpenViking only returns a top-level `telemetry` object when you request it.

Typical response shape:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "result": {"...": "..."},
  "telemetry": {
    "id": "tm_xxx",
    "summary": {
      "operation": "search.find",
      "status": "ok",
      "duration_ms": 31.2,
      "tokens": {
        "total": 24,
        "llm": {
          "input": 12,
          "output": 6,
          "total": 18
        }
      },
      "vector": {
        "searches": 3,
        "scored": 26,
        "passed": 8,
        "returned": 5
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Notes:

- `telemetry.id` is an opaque correlation id
- `telemetry.summary` is the structured payload intended for users
- summary groups appear only when the operation produced them
- numeric `0` values are omitted from the response

## Supported operations

### HTTP API

Operation telemetry is currently available on these endpoints:

- `POST /api/v1/search/find`
- `POST /api/v1/search/search`
- `POST /api/v1/resources/temp_upload`
- `POST /api/v1/resources`
- `POST /api/v1/skills`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/messages`
- `POST /api/v1/sessions/{session_id}/commit`

### Python SDK

The same telemetry model is available from the Python clients for:

- `add_resource(...)`
- `add_skill(...)`
- `find(...)`
- `search(...)`
- `create_session(...)`
- `add_message(...)`
- `commit_session(...)`
- `Session.commit(...)`

## Requesting telemetry

### JSON APIs

For JSON request bodies, `telemetry` supports these forms:

```json
{"telemetry": true}
```

```json
{"telemetry": {"summary": true}}
```

`true` and `{"summary": true}` both request the same payload: `telemetry.id + telemetry.summary`.

The object form currently exposes the `summary` switch only.

If you do not want telemetry, either omit the field or set:

```json
{"telemetry": false}
```

```json
{"telemetry": {"summary": false}}
```

### Multipart upload API

`POST /api/v1/resources/temp_upload` is a multipart form endpoint. For this endpoint, pass telemetry as a form field:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1933/api/v1/resources/temp_upload \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -F "file=@./notes.md" \
  -F "telemetry=true"
```

This endpoint currently accepts the boolean form only.
`upload_mode` is also a form field for this endpoint; it defaults to `local` and should only be set to `shared` when you explicitly need distributed shared temporary uploads. Python HTTP client / CLI users can alternatively drive the same behavior with `ovcli.conf` -> `upload.mode = "shared"`.

## Common summary groups

The top-level summary always includes:

- `operation`
- `status`
- `duration_ms`

Depending on the operation, you may also see these groups:

- `tokens`: LLM and embedding token totals
- `vector`: vector search and filtering counts
- `resource`: resource ingestion and processing stages
- `queue`: queue processing counts for wait-mode imports
- `semantic_nodes`: semantic extraction totals
- `memory`: memory extraction or dedup summaries
- `errors`: aggregated error information

If a group does not apply to the operation, it is omitted.

## Field reference

Only fields that are actually produced by an operation are returned. Missing groups should be treated as "not applicable" rather than as zero.

## Examples

### Search request with telemetry

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1933/api/v1/search/find \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -d '{
    "query": "memory dedup",
    "limit": 5,
    "telemetry": true
  }'
```

### Add a resource and return telemetry

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:1933/api/v1/resources \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-API-Key: your-key" \
  -d '{
    "path": "./docs/readme.md",
    "reason": "telemetry demo",
    "wait": true,
    "telemetry": true
  }'
```

### Python SDK

```python
from openviking import AsyncOpenVikingClient

client = AsyncOpenVikingClient(config_path="/path/to/config.yaml")
await client.initialize()

result = await client.find("memory dedup", telemetry=True)
print(result["telemetry"]["summary"]["operation"])
print(result["telemetry"]["summary"]["duration_ms"])
```

## Limitations and behavior

- OpenViking currently exposes summary-only telemetry to users
- `{"telemetry": {"events": true}}` is not a supported public request shape
- event-stream style selection is not part of the public API
- `session.commit` supports telemetry only when `wait=true`
- if you call `session.commit` with `wait=false` and request telemetry, the server returns `INVALID_ARGUMENT`
- telemetry shape is stable at the top level, but optional summary groups vary by operation
