# OpenViking Prompt Guide and Customization

This document introduces OpenViking's current prompt template system, with a focus on:

- what prompts currently exist
- which processing stage each prompt is used in
- which external capabilities or results each prompt affects
- the format requirements for template files
- how to customize prompts safely

This document only covers templates under `openviking/prompts/templates/` plus a small set of configuration items related to template loading.

## Overview

OpenViking's current prompts fall into two main groups:

1. Regular prompt templates
   - Stored under `openviking/prompts/templates/<category>/*.yaml`
   - Used to instruct the model to perform tasks such as image understanding, document summarization, memory extraction, and retrieval intent analysis
2. Memory schema templates
   - Stored under `openviking/prompts/templates/memory/*.yaml`
   - Used to define the fields, filename templates, content templates, and directory rules for a memory type

From a usage perspective, these templates mainly serve the following processing stages:

| Category | Representative template | Main purpose | Effective stage | External capability affected |
|----------|-------------------------|--------------|-----------------|------------------------------|
| `vision` | `vision.image_understanding` | Image, page, and table understanding | Resource parsing and scanned-document understanding | Image parsing, PDF page understanding, table extraction results |
| `parsing` | `parsing.context_generation` | Document structure splitting and semantic node generation | Resource ingestion and parsing | Document chapter structure, node summaries, image summaries |
| `semantic` | `semantic.document_summary` | File-level and directory-level summaries | Semantic indexing | File summaries, directory overviews, downstream retrieval quality |
| `retrieval` | `retrieval.intent_analysis` | Retrieval intent analysis and query planning | Pre-retrieval analysis | Search query planning and context recall direction |
| `compression` | `compression.ov_wm_v2` | Working-memory compression and archived-session summarization | Session commit / memory pipeline | Session compression and working-memory quality |
| `memory` | `profile` | Memory type definitions | Memory persistence and updates | The organization and final content of different memory types |
| `processing` | `processing.tool_chain_analysis` | Extracting experience from interactions or resource background | Post-processing and experience distillation | Strategy extraction, tool-chain experience, interaction learning results |
| `indexing` | `indexing.relevance_scoring` | Candidate relevance evaluation | Retrieval and indexing support | Relevance scoring quality |
| `skill` | `skill.overview_generation` | Skill information distillation | Skill resource processing | Skill retrieval summaries |
| `test` | `test.skill_test_generation` | Automatic test case generation | Test and validation support | Skill test case generation |

## Prompt Format Requirements

### Regular Prompt YAML

A regular prompt template usually contains the following fields:

```yaml
metadata:
  id: "semantic.document_summary"
  name: "Document Summary"
  description: "Generate summary for documentation files"
  version: "1.0.0"
  language: "en"
  category: "semantic"

variables:
  - name: "file_name"
    type: "string"
    description: "Input file name"
    required: true

template: |
  ...

output_schema:
  ...

llm_config:
  ...
```

Field meanings:

- `metadata`
  - Describes the template identity and category
  - `id` usually corresponds to the file path, for example `semantic.document_summary`
- `variables`
  - Defines the input variables accepted by the template
  - Common fields include `name`, `type`, `description`, `default`, `required`, and `max_length`
- `template`
  - The actual prompt body sent to the model
  - Rendered with Jinja2 variables
- `output_schema`
  - Optional
  - Describes the expected output structure so callers can constrain model output
- `llm_config`
  - Optional
  - Describes suggested model-side parameters and is not part of the prompt body itself

When writing a regular prompt, follow these guidelines:

- Keep `metadata.id` consistent with the template category and purpose
- Keep variable names stable so they stay compatible with callers
- Ensure placeholders inside `template` match the definitions in `variables`
- If the template expects structured output, specify the fields, format, and constraints clearly
- If the input is length-sensitive, control prompt size through `max_length` or upstream truncation

### Memory Schema YAML

`memory/*.yaml` files are not regular prompt text templates. They define memory types. The example below is only a schematic structure showing common fields. Whether a built-in template includes `content_template`, or whether its directory uses a subdirectory, depends on the specific memory type.

```yaml
memory_type: "profile"
description: "User profile memory"
fields:
  - name: "content"
    type: "string"
    description: "Profile content"
    merge_op: "patch"
filename_template: "profile.md"
content_template: |
  ...
embedding_template: |
  ...
directory: "viking://user/{{ user_space }}/memories/..."
enabled: true
operation_mode: "upsert"
```

Field meanings:

- `memory_type`
  - The name of the memory type
- `description`
  - The definition of the memory type and its extraction requirements
- `fields`
  - The fields included in this memory type
- `filename_template`
  - The template used to generate the file name
- `content_template`
  - The body template used when writing the memory file
- `embedding_template`
  - The template used to render the text that is embedded for semantic retrieval; when unset, a default representation is used
- `directory`
  - The directory where this memory type is stored
- `enabled`
  - Whether this memory type is enabled
- `operation_mode`
  - The update mode of the memory type, such as `upsert`

When writing a memory schema, focus on:

- whether the field granularity is stable
- whether the filename template is predictable and searchable
- whether the directory rule matches the intended retrieval scope
- whether the merge strategy is appropriate for that memory type

## Current Prompt Template Reference

The sections below list all current templates by category. Each entry explains which processing stage it belongs to and which external capabilities it mainly affects.

When reading this section, a simple rule helps:

- For regular prompt templates, focus on `Purpose` and `Key inputs`
- For memory schemas, focus on `Purpose` and `Key fields`

## How to Customize Prompts

OpenViking supports two main customization patterns:

1. Override regular prompt templates
2. Extend memory schemas

Before going into the specific methods, you can use the following table to judge change risk:

| Change type | Risk level | Notes |
|-------------|------------|-------|
| Changing prompt wording, adding examples, adjusting tone | Low | Usually only changes model behavior style and does not change the caller contract |
| Changing output style, extraction preference, or summary granularity | Medium | Changes result distribution and should be revalidated against the target capability |
| Changing variable names, output structure, or memory field names | High | Easy to break compatibility with callers or parsing logic |
| Changing `directory`, `filename_template`, or `merge_op` | Very high | Directly changes memory storage location, organization, and update behavior |

### Override Regular Prompt Templates

Applicable when:

- you want to adjust memory extraction preferences
- you want to change summarization style
- you want image understanding output to be more detailed or more concise
- you want to change retrieval intent planning behavior

Available configuration:

- `prompts.templates_dir`
- environment variable `OPENVIKING_PROMPT_TEMPLATES_DIR`

Load priority:

1. Explicitly provided template directory
2. Environment variable `OPENVIKING_PROMPT_TEMPLATES_DIR`
3. `prompts.templates_dir` in `ov.conf`
4. Built-in template directory `openviking/prompts/templates/`

In other words, regular prompt customization works by checking the custom directory first and falling back to the built-in template when the same relative path is not found.

Recommended approach:

1. Copy the target file from the built-in template directory first
2. Keep the same category directory and file name
3. Only modify the prompt body or output requirements
4. Avoid changing variable names that callers already depend on

Example directory:

```text
custom-prompts/
├── compression/
│   └── ov_wm_v2.yaml
├── retrieval/
│   └── intent_analysis.yaml
└── semantic/
    └── document_summary.yaml
```

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "prompts": {
    "templates_dir": "/path/to/custom-prompts"
  }
}
```

Or:

```bash
export OPENVIKING_PROMPT_TEMPLATES_DIR=/path/to/custom-prompts
```

Impact examples:

- Modifying `compression.ov_wm_v2`
  - mainly affects initial working-memory generation
  - ultimately affects session archive quality and downstream recall results
- Modifying `retrieval.intent_analysis`
  - mainly affects pre-retrieval query planning
  - ultimately affects search direction and recall quality
- Modifying `semantic.document_summary`
  - mainly affects document summarization
  - ultimately affects document indexing and summary output

### Extend Memory Schemas

Applicable when:

- you want to add a new business-specific memory type
- you want to adjust the field structure of an existing memory type
- you want to change memory storage directories or filename templates

Available configuration:

- `memory.custom_templates_dir`

Loading behavior:

- Built-in memory schemas are loaded first
- If `memory.custom_templates_dir` is configured, schemas in that directory are loaded afterward
- As a result, memory customization behaves more like extension and supplementation than a full replacement of the built-in set

Example directory:

```text
custom-memory/
├── project_decisions.yaml
└── user_preferences_ext.yaml
```

Example configuration:

```json
{
  "memory": {
    "custom_templates_dir": "/path/to/custom-memory"
  }
}
```

Recommendations when extending memory schemas:

- Start by following the style of existing `memory/*.yaml` files
- Confirm that the new memory type really needs to be independent
- Keep field names clear and stable for future updates
- Ensure `directory` and `filename_template` are easy to search and maintain

Impact examples:

- Adding `project_decisions`
  - affects memory persistence types and downstream search organization
- Modifying `preferences`
  - affects how user preference memories are organized and the granularity of recall
- Modifying `tools`
  - affects tool experience accumulation and tool usage recommendations

### High-Risk Changes During Customization

The following changes are the most likely to break existing workflows:

- changing variable names in regular prompts
- changing the expected output structure of a prompt without updating downstream parsing logic
- changing key field names in a memory schema
- changing `directory`, which changes retrieval scope
- changing `filename_template`, which changes how historical files are organized
- changing `merge_op`, which changes how existing memories are updated

If your goal is only to improve quality, these are usually the safer first moves:

- add clearer output examples to the prompt
- strengthen rules about what to keep and what to ignore
- adjust summary granularity or response style
- modify only one prompt category at a time instead of several at once

A conservative approach is:

1. copy the existing template first
2. change the instruction content and phrasing first
3. change structural fields last
4. modify only one prompt category at a time so impact is easier to isolate

## Validation and Troubleshooting

After modifying a prompt, validate it at two levels: whether the template was actually picked up, and whether the capability output changed as expected.

### First: Verify the Template Was Picked Up

Checklist:

- whether the custom directory is configured correctly
- whether the file path keeps the same relative path as the original template
- whether the YAML is valid
- whether the variable names still match the original template

For a regular prompt, focus on:

- whether the template was loaded correctly
- whether the target stage really uses that template

For a memory schema, focus on:

- whether the new schema was loaded successfully
- whether the target memory type actually participates in extraction and persistence

### Then: Verify That External Results Changed

The most effective validation is capability-focused:

- If you changed a `vision` template, re-parse images, tables, or scanned PDFs and check whether the results changed
- If you changed a `semantic` or `parsing` template, re-import documents or files and check whether summaries and structure changed
- If you changed a `retrieval` template, rerun the relevant search and check whether query planning and recall behavior changed
- If you changed a `compression` template, re-trigger session commit or memory processing and check whether extraction and merge results changed
- If you changed a `memory` schema, inspect the final persisted memory files, directories, and field structure

### Common Troubleshooting Patterns

Symptoms and first things to check:

| Symptom | First thing to check |
|---------|----------------------|
| Results do not change at all after modification | The custom directory is not active, or the file path does not match |
| The model reports missing variables | Template variable names do not match what callers provide |
| Returned content format is broken | The prompt output format changed, but downstream parsing still expects the old structure |
| A new memory type never appears | `memory.custom_templates_dir` is not active, or the schema was not loaded correctly |
| Retrieval quality gets worse | The `retrieval`, `semantic`, or `compression` prompt was changed too aggressively |

## Appendix

### Template Directory

Built-in prompt template directory:

```text
openviking/prompts/templates/
```

It contains:

- `compression/`: compression, extraction, and merging
- `indexing/`: relevance evaluation
- `memory/`: memory type definitions
- `parsing/`: structure analysis and semantic node generation
- `processing/`: experience and strategy extraction
- `retrieval/`: retrieval intent analysis
- `semantic/`: file and directory summaries
- `skill/`: Skill summaries
- `test/`: test case generation
- `vision/`: image, page, and table understanding

### Key Configuration Items

The main configuration items related to prompt customization are:

| Configuration item | Purpose |
|--------------------|---------|
| `prompts.templates_dir` | Override directory for regular prompt templates |
| `OPENVIKING_PROMPT_TEMPLATES_DIR` | Environment variable for the override directory of regular prompt templates |
| `memory.custom_templates_dir` | Directory for custom memory schemas |

### Practical Rule of Thumb

If your goal is:

- to change how the model speaks, extracts, or summarizes
  - modify a regular prompt template first
- to change what a memory looks like, where it is stored, or how it is organized
  - modify or extend a memory schema first

If you are not sure which layer to modify, ask yourself:

"Am I changing the model's instruction, or the structure of the final memory file?"

That question is usually enough to help decide whether you should modify a regular prompt or a memory schema.
