"""Folder scanning, modality inference, and input-side manifest diffing.

The folder-based ``memorize`` entry point treats a directory as the unit of
ingestion. This module is responsible for the *input* side of the sync:

- recursively scan a folder for ingestible files,
- infer each file's modality from its extension (skipping unknown types),
- maintain a sidecar ``.memu_manifest.json`` (``relative path -> content hash``)
  so each call can tell which files were added, modified, or deleted.

This is independent of the *output* side manifest used by ``memu.memory_fs``
(which hashes the rendered markdown artifacts).
